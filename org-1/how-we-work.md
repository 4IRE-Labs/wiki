# How we work

1. We don't start work without contract and annex signed. 
2. If you're a new client \(we haven't received payments from you before\) we start work only after prepayment.
3. An account manager is responsible for the kick-off. 
4. An account manager is responsible for telling client that works can be started only after docs signed. 
5. A partner can take responsibility for starting works without documents signed. In that case, hours won't be reimbursed if the client cancels the collaboration.
6. We have only two types of contract: Dedicated Team and T&M. 
7. If you need an estimate we can do it in 3 ways:
   1. Free estimate if the project is small \(&lt;= 1 month\)
   2. Technical Discovery workshop \(if you have complete prototype and requirements\) - 8h \(solution architect\)
   3. Design Thinking workshop \(if you don't have complete prototype and requirements\) - 16h \(designer, solution architect\)
