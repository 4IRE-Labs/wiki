Nowadays we have a lot of incubation programs all over the world where people combine their efforts to grow an idea from paper to production with minimal investing money in it. Sounds good, let's describe the process how ideas becomes projects and how incubators helps to do that.

Most incubators are paid but there are free too. Some have post-payment feature, some take constant amount of money to have ability to develop own project in that incubator.

On the first stage, you must initiate your own group of like-minded team. In case when you have only idea you can find your team during this stage. You met participants, describe your idea, make attempts to get interested more participants.  

On the other hands, when the project is done. During pitching about the developed product, founder has several minutes to get that angel investor who will invest in the start-up.

So, how many participants somebody can invite to take part in developing the project, and how many agreed developers will see the project as inventor can see?

How many angel investors can look at the developed work at the pitching day?
