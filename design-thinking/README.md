# Service Design

## Before the start checklist

* Is it human centric problem?
* How clear is the solution? \(if clear â€“ no need\)
* How ambiguous and complex is the challenge?
* Is exploration safe for the organization?
* Can we get the feedback from target audience in the short terms?

## Problem Identification

* History about the problem
* Market potential \(volume, growth etc\)
* Existent solution and what's missing

## Challenge Definition

Identify a driving question that inspires others to search for creative solutions. Define better the current state & challenge the current understanding of right.

* Briefing
* Stakeholder mapping
* Research board
* Challenge reframing

## Challenge Researching

Inspire new thinking by discovering what people really need.

* Desk research
* Persona description \(jobs to be done, pains, gains\)
* Customer journey

* Expert interview
* Ethnography \(+auto-ethnography, journal\)
* Substitute analysis \(blue ocean\)
* Reference wall
* Observation
* Interview Recruiting \(direct, ad-hoc, snowball, social networks...\)
* In-depth interviews
* Research triangulation
* Extremal users

## Solution Ideation

Push past obvious solutions to get to breakthrough ideas.

* Doodling
