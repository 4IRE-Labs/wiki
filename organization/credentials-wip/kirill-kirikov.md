Kirill was born in IT family, son of web-designer and system admin. Being close and curious about the tech stuff from the early childhood. It looks like he never had the second idea about what to do in life. He was doing free-lance contracting in school years, getting Computer Science Degree and getting lead tech positions in several companies then. He had worked on the social game with over 1 million active users daily, then developed the board computer for Ferrari and Chrysler in Luxsoft.

After being more than 12 years in the industry and knowing wide stack of technologies and languages, Kirill decided to contribute and started teaching software development courses. Best students now got the internship in the company and stayed to work further.

“Basically I want to create great apps, ones I would use mine. Now I also got a lot of young engineers who I am responsible for and I would like them to become really successful.”

Kirill likes traveling, cooking, hosting friend parties and is a big fan of owls \(even got one for himself\).
