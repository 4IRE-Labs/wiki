# DeFi Labs Thesis

The primary pitfalls of centralized financial services include:

* Unequal Access
* Censorship
* Counterparty Risk
* Opacity/Lack of Transparency

There are now companies building out a stack of financial primitives — the basic building blocks of a financial system. While these tools are in very early stages, it is possible today to use Ethereum-based protocols to take out loans, to lend money and earn a return, to buy bundles of assets, to hedge your risk, to trade assets trustlessly, and to make payments for zero fees
