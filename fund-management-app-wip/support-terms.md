# Support Service-Level Agreement

CUSTOMER: Customer Name  
SERVICE PERIOD: \(Month, Day, Year through Month, Day, Year\)  
SERVICE LEVEL: Regular

This VENDOR Service Level Agreement \(“SLA”\) between VENDOR \(“VENDOR”, “us”, “our”, or “we”\) and users of the VENDOR Services \(“CUSTOMER”, or “you”\) governs the use of the SERVICE under the provisions of the VENDOR Terms of Service \(the “Terms”\).

In order to provide optimal customer service to all departments, all issues must be received by the VENDOR help desk.

This SLA applies separately to each of your products, as defined in the Terms. This SLA does not apply to other material items.

Unless otherwise provided herein, this SLA is subject to the provisions of the Terms. Capitalized words and phrases have the meaning specified in the Terms. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this SLA in accordance with the Terms.

## DEFINITIONS

“SERVICE\(S\)” means the platform\(s\) or application\(s\) running on VENDOR systems.

“Maintenance” means scheduled Unavailability of the VENDOR Services, as announced by us prior to the VENDOR Services becoming Unavailable.

“Monthly Uptime Percentage” is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the month in which the VENDOR Services were Unavailable. Monthly Uptime Percentage measurements exclude downtime resulting directly or indirectly from any VENDOR SLA Exclusions \(refer to section 5\).

“Service Credit” means a credit denominated in US dollars, calculated as set forth below, that we may credit back to an eligible account.

“Unavailable” and “Unavailability” mean, for application services and databases, when your service or database is not running or not reachable due to VENDOR’s fault. This excludes \(a\) services that are unreachable or not running because the device’s provisioned resources \(RAM, CPU, disk, as applicable\) are insufficient; and \(b\) members of a database cluster where the cluster as a whole is not running or unreachable.

### 1\(a\). SERVICE COMMITMENT: Uptime

VENDOR will use commercially reasonable efforts to make SERVICE available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 98% during any monthly billing cycle \(the “Service Commitment”\). Subject to the VENDOR SLA Exclusions \(refer to section 6\), if we do not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit.

A Monthly Uptime Percentage of 98% means that we guarantee you will experience no more than 14 hours each month of Unavailability.

### 1\(b\). SERVICE COMMITMENT: Channels

VENDOR will provide CUSTOMER with the following support methods:

| Channel | Days/Hours |
| :--- | :--- |
| Chat | \(Monday - Friday 10:00 - 19:00\) |
| Email | \(Monday - Friday 10:00 - 19:00\) |
| Phone | 24/7 only for critical issues |

\*Business days only, all times are listed in GMT+3:00

### 1\(c\). SERVICE COMMITMENT: Response Times

| Severity Level | Definition | Response Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| System Down | Complete loss of productivity; no access to system | 2 hours |
| Critical | Business outage or significant customer impact that affects productivity | 2 hours |
| High | No immediate work stoppage; productivity is significantly reduced, time-sensitive issue that may affect future productivity; major customer impact | 8 hours |
| Medium | Issue does not significantly impact current productivity; considerable customer impact | 2 business days |
| Low | Issue requires minor investigation or monitoring; minor customer impact | 4 business days |
| Training/Information | Request for information, training, etc. | 4 business days |

## 2. SERVICE CREDITS

Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the total charges due on your invoice for the monthly billing cycle in which the Unavailability occurred, applied proportionally to the Services that were Unavailable, in accordance with the schedule below:

●   Monthly Uptime Percentage less than 98% but equal to or greater than 90.0%: Service Credit of 10% of the charges attributable to the affected resources

●   Monthly Uptime Percentage less than 90.0%: Service Credit of 30% of the charges attributable to the affected resources

For example, if you have an application service that is Unavailable for 24 hours, you would be eligible for a Service Credit of 10% of that service’s usage for the month. We will apply any Service Credits against future payments for the Services otherwise due from you. At our discretion, we may issue the Service Credit to the credit card you used to pay for the billing cycle in which the Unavailability occurred. Service Credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from VENDOR. A Service Credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar \($1 USD\). Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account.

## 3. SOLE REMEDY

Unless otherwise provided in the Terms, your sole and exclusive remedy for any Unavailability, non-performance, or other failure by us to provide SERVICE is the receipt of a Service Credit \(if eligible\) in accordance with the terms of this SLA.

## 4. CREDIT REQUEST AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES

To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by emailing the VENDOR. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us by the end of the second billing cycle after which the incident occurred and must include:

●   The words “SLA Credit Request” in the subject line;

●   The dates and times of each Unavailability incident that you are claiming;

●   The account name\(s\); and

●   Information that documents the error\(s\) and validates your claimed outage \(confidential or sensitive information should be removed or replaced with asterisks\).

If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by us and is less than the Service Commitment, we will issue a Service Credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which your request is confirmed by us. Your failure to provide the request and other information as required above will disqualify you from receiving a Service Credit.

## 5. SLA EXCLUSIONS

The Service Commitment does not apply to any unavailability, suspension, or termination of the SERVICE, or any other SERVICE performance issue:

1.     That results from a suspension or remedial action, as described in the Terms;

2.     Caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event, Internet access, or problems beyond the demarcation point of the VENDOR network;

3.     That results from any actions or inactions of you or any third party;

4.     That results from the failure of equipment, software, or other technology belonging to you or any third party \(other than third party equipment within our direct control\);

5.     That results from failures of SERVICE not attributable to Unavailability; or

6.     That results from any scheduled Maintenance.

If availability is impacted by factors other than those used in our Monthly Uptime Percentage calculation, then we may, at our discretion, issue a Service Credit considering such factors.

## 6. MODIFICATION

This agreement may be amended at any time with mutual consent of both parties.
