# Use Cases \(WIP\)

Why you better use Aragon for your Pre-ICO / ICO, even if you're not a DAO

You want to crowdfund, here’s what you’re be dealing with:

* Launch a token
* Setup a secure wallet for funds \(e.g. multisig\)
* Distribute the token \(setup pricing model, payment methods etc\)

Typical situation – select a provider \(see [comparison](https://crowdfunding3.com/resources/ico-platform-comparison)\). What we suggest is to use Aragon:

</table>Let’s review the tasks one by one.  


## Setup a secure wallet & Launch a token

With Aragon you can setup a multisig wallet. Connected to your other devices or you partners in order to preserve losing control over your tokens and funds. Each Aragon entity is coming with an ERC-20 compatible token that can be seen in wallets, put to exchange etc.

Then from there, you can assign tokens to your presale investors, team, advisors and more.

## Mass distribute the token

For mass distribution, we’re now doing a product called “community fund” or Apiary. It’s an application that can be installed inside Aragon and allow the autosale with different pricing models, accepting different currencies, etc.

### Setup a pricing model

There’re such options:

* Linear with a single price per stage \(can be several stages\)
* Continuous token model

The linear is the most used model, where you assign a price for purchase.

But if you’re interested you can check continious model as well: [https://4ire-labs.gitbook.io/apiary/research/apiary-research-by-luke-duncan](https://4ire-labs.gitbook.io/apiary/research/apiary-research-by-luke-duncan)

### Payment methods etc
