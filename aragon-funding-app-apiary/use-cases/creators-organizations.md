# Creators Organizations



[Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/) is a highly successful service for supporting the creators with $12M monthly payouts for over 100k or creators. With that Patreon has some issues with [censorship](http://www.openlettertopatreon.com/) and [high pledge fees](https://www.reddit.com/r/patreon/comments/7i8pwa/new_pledge_fee_discussion/). Not saying that it’s easily solved, though there’s a place for similar services, like [Stake Tree](https://staketree.com/). So a potential organization with more than 1 creator can do a responsible crowdfunding. It can be a podcast, youtube show, book, research etc.
