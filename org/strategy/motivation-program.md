# Motivation Program

Goals:

* Make leading several projects more profitable for the consultants

Consultants setup own rate and charge the company based on this rate for client work. Generated profits are distributed with collaborative budgeting. Unspent amount goes towards the fund or is distributed across the partners.

Insurance policy: company covers 50% of the lay-up risk.
