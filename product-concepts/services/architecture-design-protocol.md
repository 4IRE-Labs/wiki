# Architecture Design / Protocol



**Purpose:** 

Define the components of the system and how they operate on the paper to avoid costly changes in future. 

**Cases:** 

* Platio
* Kidcoin
* Smart-agreements
* Mogu
* Commade

**Who needs:**

* Startups, and enterprise software products on the pre-development stage

We're convinced that canonical approaches of software architecture in agile is a huge work upfront. That's why we think that the solution architecture and development only the high-level diagrams is enough to start the development in our very fast changing world. 

**Process:**

1. Architectural Analysis \(AA\) defines the problems an architecture must solve. The outcome of this activity is a set of architecturally significant requirements \(ASRs\).
2. Architectural Synthesis \(AS\) proposes candidate architecture solutions to address the ASRs collected in AA, thus this activity moves from the problem to the solution space.
3. Architectural Evaluation \(AE\) ensures that the architectural design decisions made are the right ones, and the candidate architectural solutions proposed in AS are measured against the ASRs collected in AA.
4. Architectural Implementation \(AI\) realizes the architecture by creating a detailed design.
5. Architectural Maintenance and Evolution \(AME\) is to change an architecture for the purpose of fixing faults and architectural evolution is to respond to new requirements at the architectural level

**Plan for expertise development**

1. knowledge sharing \(internal + speaking at conferences\)
2. adopting best practices of software design to the design of the distributed systems
3. publishing articles in the corresponding field

**TA:** Startups at \(Pre\)-Seed stage
