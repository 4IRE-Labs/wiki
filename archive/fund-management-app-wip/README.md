## Apiary

**Problem:** funding creation & development of public goods in the communities \(open source projects, research, brand, community development, education etc\).  
  
**Solution:** DAO based trust fund built on Aragon. Contributors stake tokens into organizations on the Apiary platform using a bonding curve. Funds held in the bonding curve's reserve pool are released over time into a discretionary pool to reward contributors.  
  
Splitting funds into reserve and discretionary pools provides smart-contract enforced accountability between project contributors and patrons throughout the lifecycle of a project while simultaneously ensuring sufficient liquidity to support the emergence of a long-tail of micro-organizations.
