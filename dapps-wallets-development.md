## Process

### 1. Preliminary Analysis

2-5 presale calls with tech leads, superficial examination of the project.

Deliverables: Suggestions on the overall expediency of the project, price and timeframe assessment

Duration: ~1 week

### 2. Discovery Phase

Deep dive into the project, industry analysis, specifications development.

1. Architectural Analysis \(AA\) defines the problems an architecture must solve. The outcome of this activity is a set of architecturally significant requirements \(ASRs\).
2. Architectural Synthesis \(AS\) proposes candidate architecture solutions to address the ASRs collected in AA, thus this activity moves from the problem to the solution space.
3. Architectural Evaluation \(AE\) ensures that the architectural design decisions made are the right ones, and the candidate architectural solutions proposed in AS are measured against the ASRs collected in AA.
4. Architectural Implementation \(AI\) realizes the architecture by creating a detailed design.
5. Architectural Maintenance and Evolution \(AME\) is to change an architecture for the purpose of fixing faults and architectural evolution is to respond to new requirements at the architectural level

Deliverables: Roadmap, user stories, UML diagrams, solution architecture documentation, project plan, detailed price assessment

Duration: 1-3 weeks

### 3. MVP Development

Team forming, engineering

Deliverables: Source code, API documentation, software bet–∞

Duration: 1-4 months

### 4. Refinement & Support

Testing, debugging, optimization, problem solving

Deliverables: Fully operational software, 24/7 support

Duration: continuous
