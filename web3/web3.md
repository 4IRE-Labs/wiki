# Web3 Summary

While the Web 2.0 democratized many power structures and created new opportunities, the economic engine is largely privatized and monopolized. Facebook, Uber and AirBnB have created private networks for public infrastructure which they dominate. The Web 3.0 is the antithesis of this, it’s about multiple profit centers sharing value across an open network.

## Principles

* No central point of control
* Ownership of data
* Dramatic reduction in hacks and data breaches
* Interoperability
* Permissionless blockchains
* Uninterrupted service

## Authorization

Target Audience: crypto wallets owners

[**ConsenSys Grants**](https://www.grants.consensys.net/) – will be dispersed in amounts of $10-25k via Gitcoin. Applicants will have the opportunity to apply under categories, which will be determined by the wider Ethereum community in an effort to support decentralized decision making. For now, ConsenSys will support projects that focus on infrastructure, research, user experience, design, interoperability, and developer tools. To learn more, [sign up here](https://pages.consensys.net/consensys-grants) for a dedicated newsletter to keep up to date on grant recipients and projects.

**Moloch DAO** – grants-DAO/Guild supporting the development of Ethereum. Ethereum founders Joseph Lubin and Vitalik Buterin and their respective organizations ConsenSys and the Ethereum Foundation are each donating 1,000 ether \(ETH\) to the Moloch decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\). This donation brings the organization's total funds up to $1 million, a Cointelegraph correspondent learned at the Ethereal Summit on May 10.

[**Ethereum Community Fund**](https://ecf.network/) – The Ethereum Community Fund is similar to the EF in that it wishes to advance the Ethereum ecosystem, however is backed by several founding members including Cosmos, OmiseGo, Maker, Golem, Web3 and Status. Typical grant amounts range from $10,000 to $100,000; in general, ECF will provide funding that will initially cover 6 months of runway. See previously funded ECF alumni [here](https://medium.com/ecf-review/meet-the-grantees-ecf-class-of-2018-part-ii-ff46a284a0b1). Interested parties can submit an application [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJoqPd1VeBLtmjUm4Cde_H12uFjS_a1HkSd8czRhDFCQJCPQ/viewform).

[**Ethereum Foundation**](https://app.tettra.co/teams/ethereum/pages/applying-for-ef-grants) – The Ethereum Foundation grants have committed over $11M to over 52 projects since they kicked off their program at the start of 2018. They fund projects that are committed to advancing the Ethereum ecosystem; a rather broad mandate covering public infrastructure and community goods. Preceding the funding of each wave, the EF [publishes a wish list](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/) for the types of projects that they hope to see apply.

[**Interchain Foundation**](https://interchain.io/) –The Interchain Foundation supports development around the Cosmos ecosystem. Currently, the foundation operates on an ad-hoc basis but will evolve into a fully-formed program towards the end of 2018, after the launch of the Cosmos Network.

[**Blockstack Public Benefit Corporation**](https://requestforsocialnetworks.com/) –The Blockstack Public Benefit Corporation is committing $1M to support teams building social network dapps using the Blockstack infrastucture. Each developer or team that is accepted will receive $100K.
