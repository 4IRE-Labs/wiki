### Problems with the usual approach

* Cross functional teams find it hard to align with common business objectives
* Teams often work towards unclear goals as project scope changes repeatedly
* Teams lack real data on which to base business decisions, instead relying on endless internal discussions
* Product development cycles run too long, causing teams to lose enthusiasm and focus.

### So how might we...

* Create more more and better ideas
* Enable deeper understanding, engagement and alignment with the team
* Get real data and learn faster
