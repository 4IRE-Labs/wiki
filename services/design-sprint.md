# Design Sprint

## Who uses it and when?

* startup founders – for faster product validation
* product managers – for innovation and improvements in the existent product \(like new features or side products\)

### Problems with the usual approach

* Cross functional teams find it hard to align with common business objectives
* Teams often work towards unclear goals as project scope changes repeatedly
* Teams lack real data on which to base business decisions, instead relying on endless internal discussions
* Product development cycles run too long, causing teams to lose enthusiasm and focus.

### So how might we...

* Create more more and better ideas
* Enable deeper understanding, engagement and alignment with the team
* Get real data and learn faster

### Principles

* Together Alone – optimal combination of collective intelligence and deep individual work
* Tangible Discussion – faster and more clear decision making
* Don't rely on creativity – using tested methods for mass solution ideation

### Process

### Team Composition

You must have the decision maker and a facilitator in the sprint. Besides that you can include the people with expertises you can use in the product: designers, engineers, marketers etc. Optimal composition is 5-7 people, but there's no restriction to have more or less. What's **crucial – is to have at least one subject expert** who understands the problem we're trying to solve.
