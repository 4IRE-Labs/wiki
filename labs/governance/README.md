# Network Governance

Network is a type of organization focused on connecting members for collaboration and opportunities exchange.

## Network Types

### IT / Infrastructure Networks

* Internet
* Ethereum

### Public Communities

This is the case where we’d like to do an efficient distribution of several funds and investors to a distributed network. If it’s impractical to deal with an analog registered company and the funds are allocated for a long term, we need a mechanism for keeping the initiatives live and sustainable. So somebody can start a purpose-driven initiative \(e.g. develop open-source software or maintain the documentation\) and open funds allocation for the cause.

The existent communities can understand a need for some of the work needed, e.g. game communities. There could be a request for a community management, pr & growth or something like championship organization.

The initiator in such case may be not the person in charge or most responsible — his role is to describe the need and allow the crowdfunding. As the funds start to concentrate on such DAO account it can attract the executors to step in and do the work.

**Examples:**

* Open Source
* Game communities
* Neighborhood & City Projects
* Education and Research projects

### Professional & Industry Networks

**Examples:**

* WEF & TopLink
* McKinsey network of consultants
* dgov

### Platform Cooperatives

A platform cooperative, or platform co-op, is a cooperatively owned, democratically governed business that establishes a computing platform, and uses a website, mobile app or a protocol to facilitate the sale of goods and services. Platform cooperatives are an alternative to venture capital-funded platforms insofar as they are owned and governed by those who depend on them most—workers, users, and other relevant stakeholders.

### Consortia and Associations

Networks intended to setup interoperability standards.

**Examples:**

* [Ethereum Enterprise Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/)
* Libra Network
