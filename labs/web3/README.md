# Web3

While the Web 2.0 democratized many power structures and created new opportunities, the economic engine is largely privatized and monopolized. Facebook, Uber and AirBnB have created private networks for public infrastructure which they dominate. The Web 3.0 is the antithesis of this, it’s about multiple profit centers sharing value across an open network.

## Principles

* No central point of control
* Ownership of data
* Dramatic reduction in hacks and data breaches
* Interoperability
* Permissionless blockchains
* Uninterrupted service

## Challenges

* Adoption/UX:
  * [Saving password in more a human way](adoption-ux/)
  * [CryptoGraphica](adoption-ux/storing-the-private-key/encoding-seed-phrase-to-the-picture-steganography.md)
* DevX & tools:
  * Create convenient tools for DApps development using cloud providers
* Interoperability:
  * [Enabling Decentralized Interchain Transactions between ETH and BTC with Parachains](interoperability/ethereum-bitcoin-bridge-wip.md) \([TerraBridge](interoperability/extending-maker-dao-scalability-with-btc-collateral.md)\)
* Polkadot:
  * UI / Wallets \(Besides Metamask-like wallets at the moment!\)
