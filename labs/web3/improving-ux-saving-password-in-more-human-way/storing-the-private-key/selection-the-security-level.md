# Selection the security level

Most of the crypto wallets provide the standard high level security based on the private key or mnemonic phrase. Of course it's important to keep valuable asset safe. But what if it's a single use wallet \(e.g. for storing event currency\), you want to try it first or just keep it simpler for small amounts.

The idea is in providing users the option to select the level of security they desire. With the slider you see your options and their consequences. Using this pattern can improve the experience for the mentioned use cases and maybe others as well.
