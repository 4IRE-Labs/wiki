Develop a solution that will allow owners of documents confirm, transfer and share their ownership and have information of the latest signed document on the blockchain.The development of backend and frontend, development and audit of Ethereum smart contracts, blockchain consulting and business analysis.

**Users of the platform:**  B2C users who want to create the agreement and sign digitally via the trustworthy system \( using blockchain for data immutability\)

**Solution:** Ethereum based DApp.

**Technologies:** RoR, Web3, VueJS, Solidity.

Does notarization on blockchain bring value for the end users and the business owner? Lots of the legal companies consider it like a dead technology, however we’ve launched the POC that proves the opposite. We’ve been working more that 4 years on the platform for managing the documents and suggested developing a solution that will allow owners of documents confirm, transfer and share their ownership on the blockchain. As the platform was in production, initially it was suggested considering it with the existing clients \( legal companies\) and got very positive feedback. From the tech perspective, it was considered to putting hashes of documents on public blockchains and as the hash is forever stored, so you can easily alway check out the latest version of the signed document and validation of the signature done by authorized persons. Our POC was based on public blockchain \( Ethereum\) via including it as info in the transaction block.

The main challenges we’ve faced with: Should be the timestamp part of the hash itself time-traceable server that records when blocks were broadcast. accepting a block explorer's timestamp as binding, either. 

Competitors

1\) Stampery -  stamp.io seems abandoned, the proof isn't coming through and competing services seem to have disappeared off the internet. Stampery gained notoriety because they partnered with microsoft to provide free notarization of documents on the blockchain.

 2\) Silent Notary
