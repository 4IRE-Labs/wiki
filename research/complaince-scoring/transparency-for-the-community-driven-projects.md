# Transparency for the Community-Driven Projects

Public reporting is usually attributed to big public companies, like Apple or P&G, or charities. They use funds from wide communities and therefore become responsible to them. Something similar happens now in the blockchain space, as teams rely heavily on the community.

Being transparent helps a lot in building relationships and can help many smaller organizations \(even outside of blockchain industry\). This is a brief guide on transparency with the comments from industry leaders on the topic.  


Here we’ll try to review and advise on the transparency policy from the perspective of the founders of the community-driven projects and organizations.  


## Why important

A community can be a prime source of funding, adoption, advocacy etc. Building transparent relations with it is essential. Transparency  provides the next benefits:  


* Provides trust, that decreases transactional costs
* Adds discipline to track the path
* Everybody is on the same page \(understanding right &gt; acting right\)
* Gets you feedback on improvement and support/recognition

### How you do that: Tips & Examples

Things you can make transparent:

* Strategy: vision, goals & metrics, priorities
* Org structure: roles, position, appointments, access \(chat/contacts\)
* Financial: revenue & budget \(e.g. quarterly\)
* Operations \(taking development as an example\): project KPIs, updates, release notes

It can take a form of knowledge base folder, monthly article or chat channel \(see [https://aragon.chat/channel/check-in](https://aragon.chat/channel/check-in)\). Everything on the internet is the request for comment, so ask for feedback and comments.

Overall you can start by adopting a minimal transparency policy and extending/changing it gradually as you learn. E.g. preparing a quality report can be time-consuming, starting with something simpler & less frequent is a more lean way to go.  


### Risks & Mitigation

You can publicly fuck up \(e.g. doing a mistake or missing the goals\). Well, it’s not a transparency problem initially, also what chances are that major problem won’t become known. Sure while some can become angry or upset, for others that would be a signal to support you \(which one would you like to end up with anyway?\). It’s a matter of trust – you better trust yourself and the community. Everybody makes mistakes, especially in innovations, so while you’re in the right place doing things responsibly – that would be ok.  


It can show up something demotivating like unfair compensation. Solve it by changing or explaining. If it’s discovered the open dialogue with your participation is better than silent blame.  


Your competitors will use it against you. E.g. use your product weakness or headhunt your team. Can be, if you have aggressive competitors, but not unavoidable anyways. A positive effect is that they can better coordinate better with you e.g. not pursue the same customer segments or doing the same products. Also, you can become a stronger competitor in the eyes of the market and motivate other open cards as well.  


## Conclusion

Surely, it can be scary, especially if you don’t see the people you share, not sure about their attitude and reaction. Getting positive feedback \(helping somebody to see more clearly what’s going on\) can relieve that. Getting negative feedback can motivate you for changes and give insights.

## Questions?

* How valuable do you see this article as for the project founder \(1-10\). Why?
* Have I missed something important or lied in facts?
* What can be added/improved?

I’d like to include some quotes from the projects that practice it. Would love to get the also answers to:

* What & why you report publicly?
* Some amazing story that happened to you because of transparency?
* Some major pitfall you’ve encountered? How you’ve dealt with it?
* Who else do you know, who is good in transparency, so we talk to them too?
