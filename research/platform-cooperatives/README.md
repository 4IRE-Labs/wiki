# Platform Cooperatives

For platform cooperatives, collective funds

## Challenge

* Acquiring funding
* Effective fund distribution

A platform cooperative, or platform co-op, is a cooperatively owned, democratically governed business that establishes a computing platform, and uses a website, mobile app or a protocol to facilitate the sale of goods and services. Platform cooperatives are an alternative to venture capital-funded platforms insofar as they are owned and governed by those who depend on them mostâ€”workers, users, and other relevant stakeholders.
