Synthetic data has the potential to decrease bias from AI decisioning, increase privacy, and speed up deep learning of neural networks. 

The synthetic data is created by funneling raw data through a noise-adding algorithm to construct a new data set, one that is artificially generated. The resulting data set captures the statistical features of the original information without being able to identify individual data points. Detecting fraud can be challenging because regulations restrict how information can be shared, even within banks. 

Synthetic data can help to unveil useful patterns while masking individual incidents. Uber Labs AI has been using synthetic data sets to speed up its deep learning neural networks by up to 9 times.
