# About us

Before creating innovations, you've got to assemble the team. Innovatively.

We're trying to challenge the conventional approaches to running organizations via facilitating the self-management, wholeness and proactivity among our personnel.   
  
Our management palette has one color — it's teal. We're what is known as a Teal organization — the one that promotes consciousness instead of hiring supervisors and putting pressure on the people. We appeal to our team's honesty and morality — the natural desire to do things well. And we're not giving up on that any time soon.
