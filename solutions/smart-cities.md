# Smart Cities

In smart city, urban areas use different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

## Use Cases

* Universal ID Cards \( Latest Decentralised Identity Management systems use blockchain to provide a secure mechanism for storing and validating user identities, thereby reducing identity thefts and related frauds\)
* Prioritizing Local Commerce
* Land, Property and Housing Management
* Energy / Water / Pollution Management
* [Waste Management](asset-tracking/recyclechain.md)  \(improve efficiencies surrounded the entire waste management process by using IoT sensors and AI prediction modeling\)
* Improving Public Transit \(use of blockchain to remove the rent-seekers in the ridesharing economy Uber, etc.\). 
* Interoperability for Smart Devices
* Security for IoT Devices
* Rewarding Citizenship
* Urban Planning 
* Departamental Transparency
* Universal Data Storage Platforms
* Keyless Signature Interface \(KSI\) for Hosting Government Services and Records
* Government Services  \(smart contracts can be used for digitising citizen rights and identification, transparent voting, tax, track ownership of assets, remove paper, and automate bureaucratic processes\)
* Smart Energy  \(create a more resilient power grid by using a blockchain powered p2p energy market. This removes sent seeking middle men and allows individuals to create, buy, sell, and trade energy while retaining value\)
* Smart Payments \(facilitate all municipal payments on a blockchain based solution, including: city programs, assistance, welfare, payroll, etc\).
