# Improving the recycling rates with recyclables open market on blockchain

## Stakeholders

* City / Government
* Recycling facilities
* Activists
* Citizens
* Waste Management software vendors

## Problem Hypotheses

* **PRIO** Cities need to decrease the waste rates causing dump overload 
* Citizens lack incentives to recycle more \(positive or negative\)
* Citizens need to see the effect / stats on the recycle chain
* Citizens want better distribution centers. Can be unattractive, unknown location, unstable, have lots of bums \(UA\) 
* Activists have hard time to share the culture & knowledge
* Activists want to invest in the ecology, help recycling
  * Use crypto for most efficient subsidizing 
* Recycling facilities have lack of raw materials \(recyclables\)
* Recycling facilities need to improve supply chain efficiency for better price/margin \(avoid low or negative margins\)
  * Costly transportation
  * Lack of storage capacity
  * Good recyclables can be stolen in the chain
  * Low municipal tariff / dotations

## Solutions

### Hypotheses

* Incentive can help decrease the waste rates
* There're stakeholders that are  ready to provide those incentives
* Recycling chain can be efficiently tracked with IT systems \(blockchain?\)
* Single market for recyclables is possible
* Chain can benefit from allowing permissionless / 3rd party participation in the supply chain \(e.g. collectors\)

### RecycleChain

RecycleChain is a concept of a blockchain platform for open market in the waste management space. Core of the system is the blockchain database, that’s stored and synced between all users. It will hold next data:

* Amount, type and price of waste in possession of each player
* Ownership transactions in a form of smart contracts \[1\]
* Trading balance in the internal blockchain currency \(cryptocurrency\)

### **Plastic Bank**

[Plastic Bank](https://www.plasticbank.org/) is a platform for the world to Gather Together to alleviate global poverty and Ocean Plastic. It is a convenience store for the worlds poor that accepts plastic waste as a currency, and is sustained through the use of Social Plastic.

Working with Cognition Foundry, the Plastic Bank leverages the best technology, allowing them to grow exponentially while maintaining security of transactions. Blockchain provides trust in an industry that has been fraught with corruption and danger; it provides trust to “recyclers” that their data is safe, they are safe, and their finances are safe.

### The Dnepr Regional Council

The Dnepr Regional Council approved a new strategy for handling solid domestic waste. It allows to pay for the removal and disposal of waste by the waste itself. Citizens will take the waste for recycling at special centers and receive a cashback on a special card which you can use to pay for the utility bills.

## **Notes**

1. Smart contract is an agreement performed in the code, specific example — automatically transfers owners rights to some object to the user who sends funds
