# Improving the recycling rates with recyclables open market on blockchain

## Stakeholders

* City
* Recyclers
* Citizens

## Problem Hypotheses

* Low Waste sorting rate between people in developing countries
* No incentives \(positive or negative\)
* Doesn’t connect further \(houses, districts, cities\)
* Lack of culture, knowledge
* Distribution centers are unattractive: unkown, unstable, have lots of bums
* Underload of the recycling factories
* Low Margins = Intermediary & supply chain efficiency
* Low capacity storages
* Good recyclables are stolen in the chain
* Low municipal tariff
* Corruption on the high level

### **For Households**

* Incentive to separate recyclables
* Transparency around the process

### **For distribution centers / businesses**

* Buy/Sell recyclables for better price
* Identify opportunities \(new collection spots\)

### **For Governments**

* Is autonomous \(independent\) and brings the trust layer
* Incentivizes players to track and sell their recyclables
* Allows new players to connect to the economy \(distributions centers, deliveries, small recycling facilities\)
* Allows efficient side funding
* Secure, Reliable & Easy to scale infrastructure
* Auditable for government

## Solution & Product

### RecycleChain

RecycleChain is a concept of a blockchain platform for open market in the waste management space. Core of the system is the blockchain database, that’s stored and synced between all users. It will hold next data:

* Amount, type and price of waste in possession of each player
* Ownership transactions in a form of smart contracts \[1\]
* Trading balance in the internal blockchain currency \(cryptocurrency\)

### **Plastic Bank**

[**Plastic Bank**](https://www.plasticbank.org/) is a platform for the world to Gather Together to alleviate global poverty and Ocean Plastic. It is a convenience store for the worlds poor that accepts plastic waste as a currency, and is sustained through the use of Social Plastic.

Working with Cognition Foundry, the Plastic Bank leverages the best technology, allowing them to grow exponentially while maintaining security of transactions. Blockchain provides trust in an industry that has been fraught with corruption and danger; it provides trust to “recyclers” that their data is safe, they are safe, and their finances are safe.

### The Dnepr Regional Council

**The Dnepr Regional Council** approved a new strategy for handling solid domestic waste. It allows to pay for the removal and disposal of waste by the waste itself. Citizens will take the waste for recycling at special centers and receive a cashback on a special card which you can use to pay for the utility bills.

## **Notes**

1. Smart contract is an agreement performed in the code, specific example — automatically transfers owners rights to some object to the user who sends funds
