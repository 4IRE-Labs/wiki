# Ethereum / Bitcoin bridge \(wip\)

Protocol for interchain transfers between Ethereum and Bitcoin

#### Purpose

The purpose of this proposal is to establish in details the mechanism for permission-less transferring of assets between Ethereum and Bitcoin.

#### Usecases

Cross-chain transfer between Ethereum and Bitcoin is useful in fields such as:

* **Stable coins**: External chain assets such as BTC could diversify the collaterals used in stable currencies on Ethereum.
* **Decentralized exchange**: Ability to transfer external assets onto Ethereum expands the available assets for trading.
* **Financial derivatives**: Interconnecting blockchain based assets opens up possibilities for various financial derivative products.
