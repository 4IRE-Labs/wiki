# Improving Crypto Assets Usability / Security

**Benefit:** Improving the usability while maintaining the security of crypto assets

**Approaches:**

* Seed phrase
* Visual cryptography is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information \(pictures, text, etc.\) to be encrypted in such a way that the decrypted information appears as a visual image.
* Hard wallets integration

## POC: PhotoPass

The idea: Use image-based steganography and optional password to backup your seed phrase The rationale: The offline backup is proven to be fragile to a human factor errors. The hardware may crash. The ideal backup:

* is stored on many devices and cloud
* may be visible to public

There is only one asset that we all have that satisfies those conditions. Photo.

You may take a family picture that everybody has and encode your seed phrase with or without password. Send photo and feel safe.

* Gnosis Safe
