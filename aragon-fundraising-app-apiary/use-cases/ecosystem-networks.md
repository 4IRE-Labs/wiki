# Ecosystem / Networks

\(e.g. Aragon Nest\)

This is the case where we’d like to do an efficient distribution of several funds and investors to a distributed network. If it’s impractical to deal with a analog registered company and the funds are allocated for a long term, we need a mechanism for keeping the initiatives live and sustainable. So somebody can initialise a purpose-driven initiative \(e.g. develop open-source software or maintain the Ethereum documentation\) and open funds allocation for the cause.

The initiator in such case may be not the person in charge or most responsible — his role is to describe the need and allow the crowdfunding. As the funds start to concentrate on such DAO account it can attract the executors to step in and do the work.

\(e.g. game communities\)

Finally the existent communities can understand a need for some of the work needed, e.g. game communities. There could be a request for a community management, pr & growth or something like championship organization.

So the initiator can open up a DAO for maintaining the community and start crowdfunding. And if in any case the leaders are left the work is undertaken by newcomers or it’s liquidated.
